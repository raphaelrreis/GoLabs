# GoLabs

This repository is dedicated to learning the Go programming language, exploring its features through practical examples.

## Current Structure

### Files
- **`main.go`**: A basic example demonstrating the use of the `time` package for adding delays and the `fmt` package for printing messages to the console.

### Summary

1. A 1-second delay using `time.Sleep`.
2. Printing a simple message to the console.

## How to Run

2. Initialize the module if not already done:
   ```bash
   go mod init GoLabs
